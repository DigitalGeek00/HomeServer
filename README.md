# 🏠 My Homebrew Server - Project in Development 🚀

Welcome to my documentation on creating and optimising a homebrew server. In this space, I will share my progress, configurations, and learnings as I build and improve my own server from scratch, **trying to achieve the lowest budget possible** while making the most of available resources.

💡 **Project Goal**

The purpose of this project is to build a personal server for various applications, such as network storage, hosting services, automating tasks, and exploring new technologies, all while keeping costs as low as possible. This is not just about building a server, but about **learning and experimenting** through a process of trial and error, and documenting it for those who want to replicate or get inspired by it.

I’m using **older hardware**—an which I got for almost nothing. For me it’s a perfect example of how you can build a functional server with minimal cost. I'm also fully aware of the existence of low-power solutions like Raspberry Pi or similar devices, which are far more energy-efficient. However, in this case, I'll try to solve that problem throughout configuration.

This project has an **academic and self-taught** purpose: the goal is to learn and improve along the way. The configuration I’m following works for me, but there are countless other ways to approach building a homebrew server. This is just one proposal based on the hardware I had available and the budget I could afford. I hope this can serve as **inspiration** for others to create their own server projects.

📌 **Project Contents**

🔹 **Infrastructure and Hardware** - Equipment selection and initial configuration.  
🔹 **Installation and Configuration** - Essential operating systems, tools, and settings.  
🔹 **Automation** - Scripts and tools to facilitate server management.  
🔹 **Security** - Measures to protect the server and information.  
🔹 **Use Cases** - Practical applications and performance optimisation.
