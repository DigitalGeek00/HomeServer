# 🏠 My Homebrew Server – Project in Development 🚀

Welcome to my documentation on creating and optimising a **homebrew server**.  
Here I share my progress, configurations, and lessons learned as I build and improve my own setup from scratch — aiming for the **lowest possible budget** while making the most of available resources.

## 💡 Project Goal

The goal of this project is to build a **personal server** for various applications such as:
- Network storage  
- Hosting lightweight services  
- Task automation  
- Experimenting with new technologies  

All while keeping **costs and power consumption** as low as possible.

This is not just about building a server, but about **learning through trial and error**, and documenting the process so others can **replicate or get inspired** by it.

I’m using **old repurposed hardware**, which I got for almost nothing.  
For me, it’s a perfect example of how you can build a functional server with minimal cost.  

I’m fully aware that low-power solutions like **Raspberry Pi** or similar devices are more energy-efficient — but in this case, the challenge is to **optimise performance and power usage through configuration**.

This project has an **academic and self-taught purpose**:  
the goal is to learn, improve, and understand the underlying concepts.  
The configuration I’m following works for me, but there are many valid approaches — this is just one example based on my hardware and budget.

## 🧠 Current Status (October 2025)

✅ Server running on repurposed hardware  
✅ OpenMediaVault and Docker installed  
✅ Several containers running (Plex, Transmission, Portainer)  
🟡 Next step: publish configuration files and document the full setup  

The system has been stable for a few months, used daily for **media streaming and basic automation** at home.

## 🔜 Next Update

I will document the full server configuration and share initial scripts/config files to give a clearer view of how everything is set up and running.  
This will be the first step towards making the project more reproducible for others.
