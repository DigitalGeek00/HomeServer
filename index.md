🏠 My Homebrew Server - Project in Development 🚀

Welcome to my documentation on creating and optimising a homebrew server. In this space I will share my progress, configurations and learnings as I build and improve my own server from scratch.

💡 Project Goal

The purpose of this project is to have a personal server for various applications, such as network storage, hosting services, automating tasks, and exploring new technologies. As I progress, I will document each step so that others can learn and replicate it.

📌 Project Contents

🔹 Infrastructure and Hardware - Equipment selection and initial configuration.
🔹 Installation and Configuration - Essential operating systems, tools and settings.
🔹 Automation - Scripts and tools to facilitate server management.
🔹 Security - Measures to protect the server and information.
🔹 Use Cases - Practical applications and performance optimisation.
